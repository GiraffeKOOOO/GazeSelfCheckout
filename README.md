# Gaze Self-Checkout

This is a Master's Dissertation project made by Paskal Stepien in 2022.

The aim of this project is to make a self-checkout using React.js, which is operated with gaze captured by the Tobii Eye Tracker 5.
It's a simple React.js project, so simply download the repository, run npm install and npm start to get the self-checkout application.
This application was designed to work with an eye tracker and Windows eye control, but apart from that it's just a simple self-checkout web application.
